### Project Description
This React app was built from scratch by me as the capstone project for my first 3 months at Nashville Software School. I learned a lot in that time and had a lot of fun putting all that knowledge to use to create my first real large-scale solo project.

The purpose of this app is to provide a useful digital tool for players of 5th Edition Dungeons & Dragons.
Features include:
* Choosing a Class, which determines your selection of Armor options, your list of Weapon Attacks and your Hit Points.
* Creating a Character Sheet with persistent data that automatically calculates values for you, such as Proficiency Bonus and Stat Modifiers.
* Picking skills for your Character which calculate their value based off of your stats.
* All stats/skills/weapon attacks are buttons which can be clicked on to make rolls that add their modifiers and display on screen in a modal.
* A Spellbook that can be used to select spells using a search bar, those spells are then added to your list of recorded spells and can be clicked to view their description.
* Visit all of your created Characters in the Tavern.
